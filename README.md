# rusty.hpp

## What is `rusty.hpp`?

At the core, the idea is to have implement a minimal and lightweight yet powerful and performant system to be able to emulate Rust's borrow checker and general memory model as a C++ header-only library. 

Quoting from [rust-lang.org](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/borrow_check.html), the borrow check is Rust's "secret sauce" â€“ it is tasked with enforcing a number of properties:

* That all variables are initialized before they are used.
* That you can't move the same value twice.
* That you can't move a value while it is borrowed.
* That you can't access a place while it is mutably borrowed (except through the reference).
* That you can't mutate a place while it is immutably borrowed.
* etc

Here too, `rusty.hpp` tries to add these concepts into a regular C++ codebase with ease. `rusty.hpp` also brings in additional features which are a very fundamental part of a Rust workflow like:

* Non-nullable value
* Option< T >
* Result< T, E >
* Rc (todo)
* Arc (todo)

## What to expect?

`rusty.hpp` as the time or writing this is a very experimental thing. Its primary purpose is to experiment and test out different coding styles and exploring a different than usual C++ workspace. This can also be a simple tool for C++ developers to try and get an idea of the typical workflows in a Rust dev environment staying in their comfort zone of C++. That being said, I did try my best to get the apis and behaviour to be as close to native rust as possible but obviously as one might expect there are exceptions to this. For instance, since this is not a part of the compiler itself, there is a limit to which it can go, what I mean by that is borrow errors which would usually be reported by the rust compiler at compile time will be redirected as exceptions in C++, although there are ways to not go the exception way and deal with things more gracefully, which I would go into in the examples. Another instance would be that, since C++ doesnt inherently has a strict concept of lifetime as Rust(they are not very same) cases of dangling references would also be redirected to exceptions and checks at runtime in case the main resorce gets freed.

## How to use this?

Whith all that being said, it still is a interesting library which you could easily try out in your own project. To get started all you need to do is get the header file [rusty.hpp](./rusty.hpp) and include it in your project. It heavily relies on templates to make it completely generic to be integrated anywhere. Also this has got dependencies apart from the C++20 standard library(C++20 is needed so that I could use things like std::format, concepts, etc). After that you need a C++20 compitable compiler (MSVC or gcc 13+) and you are ready to go.

## Examples / Usage

### Rust Like type proxies
`rusty.hpp` defines proxies to standard C++ types named like the Rust types also under the namespace ``rs::literals`` there are C++ literal helpers for these types.

```c++
i8 a = 45_i8;
i16 b = 45_i16;
i32 c = 45_i32;
i64 d = 45_i64;
u8 e = 45_u8;
u16 f = 45_u16;
u32 g = 45_u32;
u64 h = 45_u64;
f32 i = 45.0_f32;
f64 j = 45.0_f64;
```

### print proxies
`rusty.hpp` defines `print` and `println` methods to be like a eqivalent of Rust's `print!` and `println!` macros.

```
println("Hello World! {}", 45);
```

### The Borrow Checker 

In `rusty.hpp` the primary way to use the borrow checker is to use the `rs::Val` type wrapper around everyting. This is a special type that enfoces all the rules and manages the borrowing and ownership of the data in general. Also it is to be noted that this library doesnt use any sort of global state, everything is localized inside the `Val` type.

```
struct Foo {
  i32 a;
  i32 b;

  Foo(i32 a, i32 b) : a(a), b(b) { }
}

auto a = Val(46584); // With primitives
auto b = Val(std::string("Hello World")); // With stl
auto c = Val(Foo {4, 6}); // Pass object as it is
auto d = MakeVal<Foo>(5, 3); // Another way possible
auto e = Val(new Foo(3, 5)); // This pointer is now owned and manged by the Val and you dont need to delete it
```

Now, it is to be noted that we use Move constructors to move the data and take ownership but in C++ there is no way to implicitly know whether an object is moved properly or not, and The destructor will be called for after the move as in:

```
auto a = Val(Foo {4, 6}); // Pass object as it is
// ~Foo called here for the temporary object
```

Now, there are many very easy ways to deal with it,

* For simple object that can be easly be copied its not a issue so you could just ignore it
* For others there are two main options:
  - Implement a move constructor and desctuctor and then track the move and bypass the desctuctor call accordingly
  - Or, the easier way would be to just pass a pointer, the rest of the API will behave the same

Now about using the Val,
```
auto a = Val(45);
auto b = Val(5);
auto c = *a + *b; // here c is a i32, you can wrap it up in a Val if you want

// All of them share same api (mostly)
auto foo0 = Val(Foo{ 0, 0 }); 
auto foo1 = MakeVal<Foo>(1, 1);
auto foo3 = Val(new Foo(0, 0));
auto foo4 = Val(std::make_shared<Foo>(45, 5));
auto foo5 = Val(std::make_unique<Foo>(45, 5));
foo1->a = 2; // be it a pointer or a Object you should be able to acces inner filed like this

```


Now about the actual checks:

```
auto foo2 = foo0; // foo0's ownership is not transfered to foo2
println("foo2: {}", *foo2); // ok
println("foo0: {}", *foo0); // Error: foo0 was moved to foo2

foo0 = pass_through(foo0); // pass ownership of foo0 to pass_through function and the function returns it back
println("foo0: {}", *foo0); // Works as the ownership was returned

non_pass_through(foo0); // pass ownership of foo0 to pass_through function and it gets consumed by it
println("foo0: {}", *foo0); // Error: foo0 was moved to non_pass_through and consumed

non_pass_through(foo0.clone()); // This needs a copy enabled type
println("foo0: {}", *foo0); // Works as the ownership was cloned

// Note to avoid exception and check if a Val is a valid object or not you can use
if( foo0.is_valid() ) { ... }

// Manually forcefully invalidate/drop a Val
foo0.drop() // the resource is destroyed and this foo0 is now invalid

// Note: a Val is a non-nullable value, so it can never be null
```

About References and Borrowing:

```
{
  auto foo_ref = foo0.borrow(); // borrows immutably
  let b = foo_ref->a; // ok
  foo_ref->a = 56; // not possible as foo_ref is immutable reference to foo

  auto foo1_ref = foo1.borrow_mut(); // borrows mutably
  let b = foo1_ref->a; // ok
  foo1_ref->a = 56; // ok
}

// Borrow safety
{
  auto foo_ref0 = foo0.borrow();
  auto foo_ref1 = foo0.borrow();  // ok as multiple immutable borrows are allowed

  auto foo_ref2 = foo0.borrow_mut(); // Error as foo0 has already been borrowed immutably
}

{
  auto foo_ref0 = foo0.borrow_mut();
  auto foo_ref1 = foo0.borrow();  // Error as foo0 has already been borrowed mutably
}

// lifetime management of a ref(kinda?)
let foo3 = Val(65.0_f32);
auto foo3_ref = foo3.borrow();
non_pass_through(foo3); // loose the ownership of foo3 as its transfereed to non_pass_through
                        // and consumed there and foo3_ref now supposedly is a
                        // dangling reference
// foo3_ref.is_valid() or if(foo3_ref) // both will be false
// println("foo3_ref: {}", *foo3_ref); // Error: ref value has expired

// Note: Ref and RefMut too are non-nullable
// Note: If for some reason you managed to have multiple levels of pointers inside the Val object
         you could use .value() method of Val to access the pointers rather than the -> operator
```

About Option:

```
auto aa = Some(46);    // this is a equivalent to rust Option
auto ba = None<u32>(); // Here for none unlike rust you have to
                       // give the type annotation for the templates
                       // as we need to setup for the Some too

println("aa: {}", aa);
println("aa: {}", aa.unwrap()); // this might throw exceptions if aa is None

aa.is_some(); // check if it is some
aa.is_none(); // check if it is none

aa.as_ref(); // Option<Val<T>> -> Option<Ref<T>>
aa.as_mut(); // Option<Val<T>> -> Option<RefMut<T>>

auto aaa = Some( new Foo(45, 5) );
println("{}", aaa.unwrap()); // This throws an exception if it is None
println("{}", aaa.unwrap_or( new Foo(0, 0) )); // returns the value if its none, (wraps it up in a Val)
println("{}", aaa.unwrap_or_else([]() { return new Foo(546, 546); })); // again here it is wrapped in a Val
println("{}", *aaa.as_ref().unwrap()); // There we get a immutable reference to the object and
                                       // then unwrap it and dereferemce the reference to get value
println("{}", aaa.map<f32>([](Foo* foo ) { return (f32)foo->a; })); // Map the value to something else

aaa.cloned(); // Crates a new Option<T> cloning the internal Val
```

About Result:

```
auto ok_result = Ok<i32, str>(42); // Create a Result with Ok variant, need to give type hints for both
auto err_result = Err<i32, std::string>("Error occurred"); // Create a Result with Err variant

println("ok_result: {}", ok_result);
println("err_result: {}", err_result);

ok_result.is_ok(); // Check if the Result is Ok
ok_result.is_err(); // Check if the Result is Err
ok_result.is_valid(); // Check if the Result is valid or invalid

ok_result.ok(); // Extract the Ok value if present, otherwise None, consumes self
err_result.err(); // Extract the Err value if present, otherwise None, consumes self

ok_result.unwrap(); // Same as .ok(), but throws an exception
err_result.unwrap_err(); // Same as .err(), but throws an exception

ok_result.unwrap_or(0); // Unwrap the Ok value, or return a default value if it's an Err

ok_result.unwrap_or_else([]() { return 0; });           // Unwrap the Ok value, or execute a function to get a default value if it's an Err

ok_result.map<float>([](int value) { return static_cast<float>(value); }); // Map the Ok value to a different type

ok_result.expect("Failed to retrieve value"); // Same as unwrap(), but allows providing a custom error message

ok_result.cloned(); // Crates a new Result<T, E> cloning the internal Val
```
